	<h3>Charter Overview</h3>

	<p><strong>Last updated: 2020-05-07</strong></p>

	<p>Trek View is dedicated to helping you discover the world around you. Our imagery is intended to enhance your experience, helping you preview and explore places nearby or across the globe. We go to great lengths to make sure that imagery is useful, and reflects the world our photographers explore.</p>

	<p>To help ensure that everyone viewing Trek View imagery has a positive, beneficial experience, we’ve developed this Image Charter. It explains the criteria we use for publishing imagery and how you can use our imagery.</p>

	<p>Please check back from time to time, as we may occasionally update this charter.</p>

	<h3>Privacy and security</h3>

	<p>Trek View is committed to safeguarding individual privacy and security.</p>

	<p>As a large proportion of our imagery is captured in public areas, Trek View photographers occasionally capture faces and personal identifiable information (such as number plates) unintentionally.</p>

	<p>Trek View uses cutting-edge face and number plate blurring technology that is designed to blur identifiable faces and number plates within our imagery before it is published online.</p>

	<p>If you see that your face or number plate requires additional blurring, or if you would like us to blur your entire house, car, or body, <a href="/contact">submit a request here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Locations</h3>

	<p>Trek View will seek permission to film and publish when capturing imagery on private land.</p>

	<p>In the interest of safeguarding children, Trek View photographers do not capture imagery in places where it is likely the image of a child will be captured, including schools, playgrounds, and parks.</p>

	<h3>Environment</h3>

	<p>Trek View is committed to a negative carbon footprint.</p>

	<p>We try to reduce carbon emissions related to tour photography as much as possible. Our Trekkers are chosen, in part, on proximity to a location and capture imagery using clean methods of transportation.</p>

	<p>Of course, our Trekkers often need to use some fossil fuel burning  (e.g. travelling to a locations). Trek View offsets all travel costs to selected environmental offsetting charities. <a href="/charters/environment">Read more about this here.</a></p>
