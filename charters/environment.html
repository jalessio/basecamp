    <h3>Charter Overview</h3>

    <p><strong>Last updated: 2020-05-07</strong></p>

    <p>Trek View is dedicated to promoting conservation through sustainable travel and tourism.</p>

    <p>To help ensure that our work does not have negative environmental impact we've developed this Environment Charter. It explains some of the criteria we use to judge applications to our camera loan program and how we make other environmentally concious core operational decisions.</p>

    <p>Please check back from time to time, as we may occasionally update this charter.</p>

    <h3>Operations</h3>

    <p>Trek View recognises that our work has a negative environmental impact due to the manufacturing of equipment, shipping costs, travelling to and from a location, etc.</p>

    <p>Where possible, we try and select the most sustainable methods of transport available.</p>

    <p>The equipment used for our camera loan program is mostly reconditioned, then shared and reused for as long as possible. When this equipment reaches the end of its usable life we try to recycle it in one of two ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>For usable equipment (usually retired because of technology advancements) this is done through donations to selected charities.</li>
        <li>For unusable equipment (usually damaged or broken beyond repair) we will recycle materials.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Trek View makes all our content public using various web assets, including this website.</p>

    <p>We recognise that our web presence is also responsible for carbon emissions and offset these costs too.</p> 

    <h3>Tour photography</h3>

    <p>To help reduce the environmental impact associated with tour photography our Trekkers are chosen, in part, based on proximity to a location and capture imagery and the methods of transportation they will use.</p>

    <p>In some cases, we might reject camera loan applicants based on the environmental or cultural sensitivity of a location where public awareness might have a negative effect on the local area or community.</p>

    <h3>Carbon offsetting</h3>

    <p>Trek View is committed to be transparent about how we calculate and offset our carbon emissions.</p>

    <p>We choose products and services that allow us to offset our carbon emissions directly (e.g. when booking travel).

    <p>If it is not possible to directly offset emissions, Trek View will calculate and donate to a different charity related to carbon offsetting.</p>

    <p>In the interest of transparency, we will make all our calculations and donation information public in our quarterly reports.</p>
