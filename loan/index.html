	<h3>About the Trekker Loan program</h3>

	<p>Our cameras are designed to capture imagery on foot, by bicycle, paddle-boarding and even underwater whilst scuba-diving.</p>

	<p>We evaluate applications to our camera loan program against our aims as an organisation to:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Show children and adults the beauty of our planet and inspire them to help protect it.</li>
			<li>Give organisations and communities the ability to market themselves on the world's stage to promote sustainable tourism rather than environmental destruction.</li>
			<li>Capture environments at risk of being lost, through natural or man-made means, to expose the damage being done.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p><a href="/blog/category/updates/">Occasionally we also make a "call for trekkers" to map particular environments</a>. This is designed as guidance, and we regularly accept applications outside of this scope.</p>

	<p>It is important you application conforms to our <a href="/charters/environment/">Environment Charter</a>.</p>

	<p>If your application is successful, we will loan you a camera free of charge including postage costs. Please note, we do not cover transportation, accommodation or other incidental costs related to projects.</p>
