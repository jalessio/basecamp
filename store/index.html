  	<h3>Trek Pack v2</h3>
  	<p><em>Coming soon</em></p>
  	<p>Our Trek Packs have travelled thousands of kilometres to capture stunning 360-degree photos. Using feedback from v1 customers and trekkers we are making refinements to produce the Trek Pack v2 for mid-2020.

  	<p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>A rugged, waterproof, 8K, Street View compatible 3D camera.</li>
  			<li>Storage and battery life for tours up to 20 kilometres on foot (equal to 87,000 3D images).</li>
  			<li>A daypack mounting system</li>
  			<li>Software to process imagery on non-professional grade equipment.</li>
  		</ul>
