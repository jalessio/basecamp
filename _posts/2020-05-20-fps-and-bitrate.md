SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s microSDXC 64GB Memory Card Review
The read speed has been increased to 80MB/s from the 40MB/s of the previous card. The write speed, although not directly stated, retains the same Class 10 rating, meaning the card can sustain at least 10MB/s continuous recording.



**_A (long) note on FPS and Bitrate_**

The number of frames captured in a video typically defined as frames per second (FPS) or frame rate. It is often a setting that can be configured on 360 camera, depending on what you're shooting.

At a high-level; more FPS = a smoother visual experience.

As a guide, [film and TV is shown at 24 FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).

Super slow motion videos (like those from the [Slow Mo Guys](https://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys)), are shot using cameras with a very high frame rate (this might seem counterintuitive at first).

[The GoPro Fusion camera can shoot 360 video in 5.2k (no protune) at max bitrate of 60 Mbps]:

<table class="tableizer-table">
<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>MODE / FPS</th><th>BITRATE / NO PROTUNE</th><th>BITRATE / WITH PROTUNE</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>5.2K30</td><td>45</td><td>60</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3K60</td><td>45</td><td>60</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

That last column is important!

Bit rate is the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. Mbps = MegaBITs per second (not to be confused with megaBYTES) is one of those units. You are probably familiar with paying for your internet connection in packages based on Mbps (Or Gbps - Gigabits per second if you're really lucky!).

1 megaBIT = 0.125 megaBYTES.

Sp the Fusion can write data at a max of 60 megabits per second or 7.5 megabytes per second, assuming the memory (micro SD Card in the case of the Fusion) can support it...

For example, the SanDisk Ultra 80MB/s microSDXC 64GB Memory Card (not a paticualrly high-performing card) write speed, although not directly stated, has Class 10 rating, meaning the card can sustain at least 10MB/s (80 megabits/s) continuous recording. My advice, buy the card with the best write performance you can afford.
